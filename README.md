This repository stores projects I've made for fun to explore Python and its exciting capabilities. There could be a wide range of projects, from experimenting with AI to even a simple text adventure game. Below, I've written a brief description of each uploaded project and why I created it.

-- 0llama_experiment.py --

This short script uses the ollama library to bring an AI model into a Python script. This project is the beginning of my experimentation with AI. The program brings in a lightweight AI model, the phi3:mini, and functions as a simple chatbot.

I created this project because I've been very interested in learning more about AI as it grows. I used a lightweight, less intelligent model so that I could run it somewhat effectively with only laptop resources. 
Moving forward, I'd like to expand on this project in a few ways:
- Activate using a keyword like a smart home assistant
- be able to read, write, and create/delete files of various formats
- recognize objects using the device's camera
- make it a separate app so that it does not have to be run in a terminal
